	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules that have been linked to various diseases, including cancer. However, a precise function and working mechanism are lacking for the larger majority. Following many different experimental and computational approaches to identify circRNAs, multiple circRNA databases were developed as well. Unfortunately, there are several major issues with the current circRNA databases, which substantially hamper progression in the field. First, as the overlap in content is limited, a true reference set of circRNAs is lacking. This results from the low abundance and highly specific expression of circRNAs, and varying sequencing methods, data-analysis pipelines, and circRNA detection tools. A second major issue is the use of ambiguous nomenclature. Thus, redundant or even conf licting names for circRNAs across different databases contribute to the reproducibility crisis. Third, circRNA databases, in essence, rely on the position of the circRNA back-splice junction, whereas alternative splicing could result in circRNAs with different length and sequence. To uniquely identify a circRNA molecule, the full circular sequence is required. Fourth, circRNA databases annotate circRNAs’ microRNA binding and protein-coding potential, but these annotations are generally based on presumed circRNA sequences. Finally, several databases are not regularly updated, contain incomplete data or suffer from connectivity issues. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current circRNA databases and their content, features, and usability. In addition to discussing the current issues regarding circRNA databases, we come with important suggestions to streamline further research in this growing field.},

	abstract = {Background: Precise prediction of cancer types is vital for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Through a predictive model, important cancer marker genes can be inferred. Several studies have attempted to build machine learning models for this task however none has taken into consideration the effects of tissue of origin that can potentially bias the identification of cancer markers.
Results: In this paper, we introduced several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that take unstructured gene expression inputs to classify tumor and non-tumor samples into their designated cancer types or as normal. Based on different designs of gene embeddings and convolution schemes, we implemented three CNN models: 1D-CNN, 2D-Vanilla-CNN, and 2D-Hybrid-CNN. The models were trained and tested on gene expression profiles from combined 10,340 samples of 33 cancer types and 713 matched normal tissues of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our models achieved excellent prediction accuracies (93.9–95.0\%) among 34 classes (33 cancers and normal). Furthermore, we interpreted one of the models, 1D-CNN model, with a guided saliency technique and identified a total of 2090 cancer markers (108 per class on average). The concordance of differential expression of these markers between the cancer type they represent and others is confirmed. In breast cancer, for instance, our model identified well-known markers, such as GATA3 and ESR1. Finally, we extended the 1D-CNN model for the prediction of breast cancer subtypes and achieved an average accuracy of 88.42\% among 5 subtypes. The codes can be found at https://github.com/chenlabgccri/CancerTypePrediction.
Conclusions: Here we present novel CNN designs for accurate and simultaneous cancer/normal and cancer types prediction based on gene expression profiles, and unique model interpretation scheme to elucidate biologically relevance of cancer marker genes after eliminating the effects of tissue-of-origin. The proposed model has light hyperparameters to be trained and thus can be easily adapted to facilitate cancer diagnosis in the future.},

	abstract = {The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network has made public a large collection of clinical and molecular phenotypes of
more than 10 000 tumor patients across 33 different tumor types. Using this cohort, TCGA has published over 20 marker papers
detailing the genomic and epigenomic alterations associated with these tumor types. Although many important discoveries have
been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological
pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval
and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor
package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow
users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics
into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group. Using four
different TCGA tumor types (Kidney, Brain, Breast and Colon) as examples, we provide case studies to illustrate examples of
reproducibility, integrative analysis and utilization of different Bioconductor packages to advance and accelerate novel discoveries.},

	abstract = {Background: Many evidences have demonstrated that circRNAs (circular RNA) play important roles in controlling gene expression of human, mouse and nematode. More importantly, circRNAs are also involved in many diseases through fine tuning of post-transcriptional gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs which associate with diseases. Therefore, identifying the circRNA-disease associations is very appealing to comprehensively understand the mechanism, treatment and diagnose of diseases, yet challenging. As the complex mechanism between circRNAs and diseases, wet-lab experiments are expensive and time-consuming to discover novel circRNA-disease associations. Therefore, it is of dire need to employ the computational methods to discover novel circRNA-disease associations. Result: In this study, we develop a method (DWNN-RLS) to predict circRNA-disease associations based on Regularized Least Squares of Kronecker product kernel. The similarity of circRNAs is computed from the Gaussian Interaction Profile(GIP) based on known circRNA-disease associations. In addition, the similarity of diseases is integrated by the mean of GIP similarity and sematic similarity which is computed by the direct acyclic graph (DAG) representation of diseases. The kernels of circRNA-disease pairs are constructed from the Kronecker product of the kernels of circRNAs and diseases. DWNN (decreasing weight k-nearest neighbor) method is adopted to calculate the initial relational score for new circRNAs and diseases. The Kronecker product kernel based regularised least squares approach is used to predict new circRNA-disease associations. We adopt 5-fold cross validation (5CV), 10-fold cross validation (10CV) and leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) to assess the prediction performance of our method, and compare it with other six competing methods (RLS-avg, RLS-Kron, NetLapRLS, KATZ, NBI, WP). Conlusion: The experiment results show that DWNN-RLS reaches the AUC values of 0.8854, 0.9205 and 0.9701 in 5CV, 10CV and LOOCV, respectively, which illustrates that DWNN-RLS is superior to the competing methods RLS-avg, RLS-Kron, NetLapRLS, KATZ, NBI, WP. In addition, case studies also show that DWNN-RLS is an effective method to predict new circRNA-disease associations.},

	abstract = {Circular RNA (circRNA), a kind of special endogenous RNA, has been shown to be implicated in crucial biological processes of multiple cancers as a gene regulator. However, the functional roles of circRNAs in breast cancer (BC) remain to be poorly explored, and relatively incomplete knowledge of circRNAs handles the identiﬁcation and prediction of BC-related circRNAs. Towards this end, we developed a systematic approach to identify circRNA modules in the BC context through integrating circRNA, mRNA, miRNA, and pathway data based on a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. Thirteen circRNA modules were uncovered by our approach, containing 4164 nodes (80 circRNAs, 2703 genes, 63 miRNAs and 1318 pathways) and 67,959 edges in total. GO (Gene Ontology) function screening identiﬁed nine circRNA functional modules with 44 circRNAs. Within them, 31 circRNAs in eight modules having direct relationships with known BC-related genes, miRNAs or disease-related pathways were selected as BC candidate circRNAs. Functional enrichment results showed that they were closely related with BC-associated pathways, such as ‘KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) PATHWAYS IN CANCER’, ‘REACTOME IMMUNE SYSTEM’ and ‘KEGG MAPK SIGNALING PATHWAY’, ‘KEGG P53 SIGNALING PATHWAY’ or ‘KEGG WNT SIGNALING PATHWAY’, and could sever as potential circRNA biomarkers in BC. Comparison results showed that our approach could identify more BC-related functional circRNA modules in performance. In summary, we proposed a novel systematic approach dependent on the known disease information of mRNA, miRNA and pathway to identify BC-related circRNA modules, which could help identify BC-related circRNAs and beneﬁts treatment and prognosis for BC patients.},
